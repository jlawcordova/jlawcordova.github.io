description: A look back to what I did and accomplished this year 2023.
---

2023 was one heck of a year for me. This is the first year I fully worked as a senior software engineer - and architected a system from the ground up.

I want to take a look back at all the things I worked on and accomplished this year 2023. Inspired by [Julia Evan's yearly "brag document"](https://jvns.ca/#year-in-review).

## 2023 Goals: Did I manage to hit them?

When I started 2023, I brainstormed what main goal I had to have. I ended up with

> "Become a sought-after tech lead."

To avoid misinterpretation, let me breakdown what a "sough-after" [tech lead](https://www.engineeringladders.com/TechLead.html) meant to me.

1. Be skilled to be able to work as a tech lead.
2. Share enough knowledge to be known as a tech lead.

Reflecting back, I can say that I made some progress towards achieving this goal. Here are some of the things I managed to accomplish:

- I was able to ship on projects in my dayjob.
- I was able to develop and deploy [the Cloud Resume Challenge](https://jlawcordova.com/devops/2023/07/16/taking-on-the-cloud-resume-challenge/).
- I was able to finish the AWS Solutions Architect Learning Accelerator program.
- I was able to acquire the [AWS Partner: Accreditation (Technical) badge](https://www.credly.com/badges/c495f857-b0e8-484d-97d0-6a261a85c2cc/linked_in_profile).
- I was able to share weekly updates on social media.
- I was able to plan and run a company [tech talk](https://netzontechtalkq1y2023.splashthat.com) event.

## Projects with Netzon

This year I was able to work and make substantial contribution on exciting projects with [Netzon](https://netzontech.com) - the IT consultancy firm I am currenty working for. I have to note though that I won't be able to provide the names of these projects as they are still under NDA. So for now, I'll just call them under a code name.

### Charms: a custom jewelry eCommerce site

This year I got to work on an eCommerce site which sells custom jewelry - let's call it Charms. Charms lets customers design and purchase their own jewelry on the site.

This was the most major project I got to work on this year - and one where I got stretched as a tech lead.

I made the first technical proposals for Charms - which contributed to our consultancy firm acquiring the project. I also planned out the architecture for Charms. We made use of BigCommerce and NextJS for the headless commerce site. When the project began, I worked on delegating tasks to my team - working with them to define, develop and deploy features.

Lastly, as part of a 5-member team, I was also "the DevOps guy" for the project - in charge of setting up cloud resources using the [Linode Kubernetes Engine](https://www.linode.com/products/kubernetes/) and CI/CD using Gitlab, whilst fully documenting the entire process in our monorepo.

Charms was launched on October. Optimization and additional feature development are still presently ongoing.

### MH: an ADHD coach

In the beginning of the year, I got to work on an interesting project, codename MH. MH is a mobile app geared towards guiding parents take care of their children who have ADHD.

Although not formalized in titles, I acted as a technical project manager for MH. I gathered and wrote requirements, planned sprints and milestones, coordinated resources, and managed expectations and deliverables for the project.

We managed to ship the project to open testing early March.

## Outside of Netzon

Outside of my 9-to-5 job, I did some technical personal projects. I do this to keep my technical skills sharp - as my day-job is more on soft skills side of things.

### The Cloud Resume Challenge

In the first half of the year, I made a ["cloud resume"](https://resume.jlawcordova.com). This is part of [The Cloud Resume Challenge by Forrest Brazeal](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev). It makes use of a wide set of cloud resources and has the goal of allowing you to apply your knowledge of the Cloud.

I got hands-on with Terraform, Github Actions and AWS resources (S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, etc.). I wrote a full blog on The Cloud Resume Challenge [here](https://jlawcordova.com/devops/2023/07/16/taking-on-the-cloud-resume-challenge/).

### React and NextJS

I used to be more of a Backend kind of guy - mostly working on Restful APIs and ASP.NET Core technologies - you'd be able to tell from my previous blogs!

But this year, as I leaned more toward the tech lead role, I can't help but be more of a generalist. This meant I had to familiarize myself with other set of technologies as a software engineer - particularly in the frontend.

So this year, I read the [React](https://react.dev/learn) and [NextJS 14](https://nextjs.org/docs) documentation from end-to-end. I also made a [sample project](https://elevation-fitness-gym.vercel.app) which utilizes multiple React concepts (Contexts, Reducers, Hooks),
and NextJS concepts (App Router, Client and Server Rendering) to demonstrate applied learning.

I also made a [custom React component] that reengineered a cool component from the official Pokemon TCG site (I got into Pokemon Trading Cards this year!).

### Podcasts

I made a habit of listening to Podcasts. I like listening to stuff more towards the tech lead role. I really like the [Soft Skills Engineering with Dave & Jamison](https://softskills.audio) which talk about aspects of software development beyong code in a light manner.

Other podcasts I listened to this year:

- [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast)
- [Syntax](https://syntax.fm)
- [How I Built This](https://wondery.com/shows/how-i-built-this/)

## What's in store for 2024?

My goal will remain for 2024. Become a sought-after tech lead. Although I've made progress, I still think I'm still far off from that goal.

Some of the things that I would like to achieve are:

- Get an AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification.
- Share more tech-related posts on social media (and write blogs more often!).
- Spearhead and improve front-end unit testing and observability for the Charms project.

## Thanks

Lastly, I want to thank all the people that helped me in my career as a software engineer.

- Gil Regalado - my technical manager, for providing guidance in navigating the tech lead role.
- Miss Charisse Yap - Netzon's CEO, for providing opportunities for me to grow all year long.

Shout out to my teammates Zerxa, Michelle, Justin, Rai, Jason, Edward, Bejay and Julius.

Looking forward to a great 2024!

description: A look back to what I worked on and accomplished this year 2023.
---

2023 has been an extraordinary year for me. It marked my first full year as a Senior Software Engineer, during which I took on the challenge of architecting a system from scratch.

I want to take a look back at all the things I worked on and accomplished this year 2023. This post is inspired by [Julia Evan's yearly "brag document"](https://jvns.ca/#year-in-review).

## 2023 Goals: Did I hit them?

At the onset of 2023, I set a primary goal:

> "Become a well-regarded tech lead."

This goal was two-fold:

1. **Enhancing my capabilities** to fulfill the role of a tech lead effectively.
2. **Sharing knowledge** to establish myself as a recognized figure in tech leadership.

Reflecting back, I can say that I have made progress toward this goal. Key achievements include:

- Delivering projects in my day job.
- Developing and launching the [the Cloud Resume Challenge](https://jlawcordova.com/devops/2023/07/16/taking-on-the-cloud-resume-challenge/).
- Completing the AWS Solutions Architect Learning Accelerator program.
- Earning the [AWS Partner: Accreditation (Technical) badge](https://www.credly.com/badges/c495f857-b0e8-484d-97d0-6a261a85c2cc/).
- Regularly updating my career progression on social media.
- Organizing and leading a company [tech talk](https://netzontechtalkq1y2023.splashthat.com) event.

## Projects at Netzon

This year, I contributed significantly to projects at [Netzon](https://netzontech.com), an IT consultancy firm. Due to confidentiality agreements, Iâ€™ll refer to these projects by codenames.

### Charms: a custom jewelry eCommerce site

Charms, an eCommerce platform for custom jewelry, was a highlight project for me. My role involved:

- Drafting the initial technical proposal, which was instrumental in winning the project bid.
- Architecting the e-commerce platform using BigCommerce and NextJS.
- Leading a team of five, handling task delegation and development oversight.
- Taking on the role of DevOps lead, setting up cloud resources with [Linode Kubernetes Engine](https://www.linode.com/products/kubernetes/) and establishing CI/CD pipelines using Gitlab.

Launched in October, Charms is now in a phase of ongoing optimization and feature development.

### MH: an ADHD coach

In the beginning of the year, I worked on a mobile app codenamed MH, designed to assist parents of children with ADHD.

My unofficial role as a technical project manager involved requirement gathering, sprint planning, and project coordination. The app entered open testing in early March.

## Ventures Beyond Netzon

Apart from my primary job, I engaged in personal projects to sharpen my technical skills.

### The Cloud Resume Challenge

I built a ["cloud resume"](https://resume.jlawcordova.com) as part of [The Cloud Resume Challenge by Forrest Brazeal](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev).

This project allowed me to gain practical experience with Terraform, GitHub Actions, and various AWS services.

I wrote my journey on a [blog post](https://jlawcordova.com/devops/2023/07/16/taking-on-the-cloud-resume-challenge/).

### Diving into Frontend Development

Transitioning from a backend-focused developer to a more versatile tech lead, I dove into frontend technologies this year.

I read the [React](https://react.dev/learn) and [NextJS 14](https://nextjs.org/docs) documentation from end-to-end. I made a [sample project](https://elevation-fitness-gym.vercel.app) demonstrating concepts such as contexts, app routers and client and server rendering.

I also made a [custom React component](https://github.com/jlawcordova/card-showcase/blob/main/app/lib/shiny-card/shiny-card.tsx) that reengineered a cool component from the official Pokemon TCG site (I also got into Pokemon Trading Cards this year!).

### Podcasts

I made a habit of listening to Podcasts this year. I got fond of listening to stuff geared more towards the tech lead role - like the [Soft Skills Engineering with Dave & Jamison](https://softskills.audio) which talks about aspects of software development beyond code.

Other podcasts I listened to this year:

- [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast)
- [Syntax](https://syntax.fm)
- [How I Built This](https://wondery.com/shows/how-i-built-this/)

## What's in store for 2024?

My goal will remain for 2024: to become a well-regarded tech lead. While I've made considerable progress, there's still a journey ahead. I plan to:

- Obtain the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification.
- Increase my social media presence and blog more frequently.
- Lead improvements in front-end unit testing and observability for the Charms project.

Here's to a productive and fulfilling 2024!
